  <div>
    <h1>Holding the wall.</h1>
    If you ever finish trapped in a maze by accident,<br/>
    you can get out by simply holding your hand on the left or right wall<br/>
    and following it until you find the end.
    <h2>The Bot</h2>
    You can emulate this dynamic by checking if there is a wall to your left<br/> and either going forward then returning to left or right then to the condition.
  </div>
